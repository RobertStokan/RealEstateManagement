# RealEstateManagement
C++ demo application

This application manages real estate listings. Please ensure that the included files are 
placed into the same directory as the program when it is run.  

The application can be utilized with or without the optional listings file. If you do choose to load the file,
please type the whole file name with extension when prompted (i.e., "listings.txt").

Likewise, please type the full file name ("changes.txt") if you choose the option "Apply Changes File".
